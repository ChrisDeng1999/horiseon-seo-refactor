# Horiseon SEO Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the HTML and CSS files in order to make the code more semantic as well as make the code cleaner. I was able to delete lines of code that were repeated as well as condense lines of code overall shortening the amount of lines of code this project originally had while still maintaining the websites style and functionality.
